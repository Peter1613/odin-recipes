odin-recipes: 
The current project is odin-recipes for w7d2. The purpose is to practice building a basic website.
It was a lot of fun putting this together step-by-step. I learned about the line break function so that I could put my recipe titles on different lines, the width and length of images because the Rice-A-Roni photo was gigantic before I cut it down, and enjoyed the way the index.html file can stay neat by using hrefs to link to the actual recipes.
