# odin-recipes
# The current project is odin-recipes for w7d2.

# It was a lot of fun putting this 
# together step-by-step. I learned about the line break <br> function so that I could
# put my recipe titles on different lines, the width and length of images because the # Rice-A-Roni photo was gigantic before I cut it down, and enjoyed the way the 
# index.html file can stay neat by using hrefs to link to the actual recipes.
