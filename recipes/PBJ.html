      <h2>Description:</h2>
      Mmmmm...Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich - An inexpensive, time-saving dish that is dessert and a meal all in one. Oh GOD yes!!!
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    Any flavor you like of jam, jelly, fruit spread, etc., white or wheat bread, creamy or crunchy peanut butter. It's really up to you as these are only guidelines. Get creative and mix it up! This is your chance to choose and shine. I like Polaner All-Fruit cherry or grape spread but there are many other good jams, jellies, spreads, etc. Use French bread and honey instead of jelly, if you want.</p>
      <h4>Steps:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Buy or have on hand: jelly, bread, peanut butter.</li>
        <li>Take two slices of bread and spread peanut butter on one and jelly on the other. I recommend two tablespoons or so each of the peanut butter and jelly for this step but you may enjoy more or less. If you're really hungry, 1/3 cup or a half a cup of peanut butter may be necessary! Maybe you love jelly, and would like more and you don't mind it falling out of the sides of the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Important: Turn the bread slice with the peanut butter onto the bread Slice with the jelly. Do not attempt to turn the bread with the jelly because it might spill.</li>
        <li>Optional: Slice sandwich in half and/or drink with milk.</li>
        <li>Open mouth and cram it in. (Disclaimer: Webmaster, author, owner, etc. is not responsible for choking if you actually do this and forget to chew.)</li>
